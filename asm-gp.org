** Introduction
This work uses Evolutionary Computation (EC) to evolve the assembly
(ASM) code compiled from existing programs with the goal of fixing
bugs in the original source code.

All [[file:code.org::gp-operations][GP Operations]] operate directly on the level of the assembly code
with no intermediate representation.

Unit tests from the original program are used to assess the fitness of
evolved variants and determine when the bug has successfully been
repaired.

This project is implemented entirely in [[http://clojure.org][clojure]], a lisp which runs on
the Java Virtual Machine and has a robust infrastructure for
multithreaded programming.

This page is intended to enable reproduction of this work.  Both the
[[file:code.org][source code]] and [[file:instructions.org][instructions for reproduction]] are provided.

  :END:

The following steps can be followed to repair a buggy program at the
assembly level.  Not that this process involves the execution of
arbitrary assembly code, which can be *very* harmful.  It is
recommended that all of the following steps take place inside of a
virtual machine.

The following will operate upon a simple buggy implementation of
Euclid's algorithm for the greatest common divisor.  This will require
obtaining the code and support files, configuring a working clojure
instillation, performing fault localization to isolate buggy portions
of the ASM file, running evolution of new program variants until a
solution is found.

** setup
1) The source-code and all support files are available at
   [[file:asm-gp.tar.bz2][asm-gp.tar.bz2]].

2) See [[http://clojure.org/getting_started]] for information on
   configuring a working Clojure environment on your machine.

3) Once the code is installed on your machine, unpack the =gcd=
   directory.  This directory should include the following,
   #+begin_example
     $ ls gcd
     gcd.c        output.1071.1029     output.555.666  output.8767.653  test-good.sh
     output.0.55  output.16777216.512  output.678.987  test-bad.sh
   #+end_example
   including the buggy program (=gcd.c=), shell scripts for executing
   the good and bad test cases respectively (=test-good.sh=,
   =test-bad.sh=), and a number of files containing the correct output
   for various inputs (=output.*=).

4) Now install [[http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/news/][oprofile]], which will be used for fault localization.
   On Debian systems =oprofile= can be installed with
   : apt-get install oprofile

5) Both [[http://gcc.gnu.org/][gcc]] and [[http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/][gdb]] are, the GNU C compiler and debugger, are assumed
   to be available on your system.

** application of technique
1) compile to asm
   : gcc -S source.c
2) generate executable
   : gcc -o source source.s
3) generate memory mapping for good/bad paths
   : mem-mapping.clj source.s source
4) sample execution with =opannotate= for both the good and bad test cases
   1) stop the daemon
      : sudo opcontrol --shutdown
   2) clear out old information
      : sudo opcontrol --reset
   3) start up the daemon
      : sudo opcontrol --start
   4) run the [good/bad] test 100 times
      : for i in `seq 100`; do
      :     ./test-[good/bad].sh ./source /dev/null 2> /dev/null
      : done
   5) dump the annotations to lines in the assembly file and save the
      results in [good/bad].path
      : opannotate --assembly source\
      : | ../opannotate-to-path.clj > [good/bad].path
      if =opannotate= hasn't sampled any points it will print the
      following line
      : error: no sample files found: profile specification too strict ?
      in that case, re-run the previous step with an order of
      magnitude more iterations (e.g. =seq 1000= instead of =seq 100=)
5) turn off =opcontrol=
   : sudo opcontrol --shutdown
6) Once the good and bad path files have been created the actual
   evolution of program variants can begin.  Once again it is worth
   mentioning that this step should be performed inside of a virtual
   machine as arbitrary assembly code will be executed, and will in
   all likelihood take actions which would be considered malicious one
   inclined to assign motives to artifacts of random mutation.

   The =modify.clj= script controls the entire evolution process.
   It's build-in help command should be sufficient to describe it's
   usage.  As with the rest of this project, everything should be
   considered to be in early alpha development, and the source-code is
   the ultimate form of documentation.  A single run can be performed
   with the following command
   : nice modify.clj --tour --tour-size 2 --pop 400 --cross-rate 0.1 source.s
   try
   : modify.clj help
   for more command line options.

   After each generation the best individual will be written to a
   =.clj= file of Clojure source code.  These individuals can be
   loaded into a Clojure repl from which they can be inspected, and
   can be written to assembly files (see [[file:code.org::assembly-manipulation][Assembly Manipulation]] and
   [[file:code.org::utility-functions][Utility Functions]]).

interesting things to collect
- GP operations
- fitness
- number of fitness operations

So an individual will look like...
- :representation :: the representation, the actual lines of code
- :fitness :: the numerical fitness of the individual, or nil if it is
     yet to be computed
- :trials :: number of the total number of fitness trials (global)
     that have been performed when the individual last had it's
     fitness determined
- :operations :: a list of the gp operations applied thus far (or nil
     for the baseline individual)
- :compile :: true or false

Sometimes these commands will hang forever holding up the entire
machinery of GP.

Sadly the only reasonable fix here is to move from list
representations to InstructionList representations.

so when I'm inserting new byte-codes into the lists of instructions,
the instruction targets aren't being updated -- probably because I'm
not using the built-in insertion function.

Is there a way to automatically update the targets of instructions
when an instruction changes it's position using .setPositions?

  oprofile is a nice idea. You've sidesteped one implementation
  bottleneck. However, oprofile is statistical and not
  deterministic. One experiment you may want to run (or one threat to
  validity you may want to mention in a paper) is the effect of noisy
  fault localization on repair success and effort.

**** java tools
Java provides a number of tools for the generation and inspection of
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode][byte codes]].
- =javac= is the compiler which can be used to turn a java file into
  compiled binary byte code
  : javac gcd.java
  results in the creation of a binary =java.class= file containing the
  byte-codes
- =javap= can be used to disassemble the resulting class file
  : javap -c gcd
  outputs the following list of the java bytecode instructions
  #+begin_example
    javap -c gcd
    Compiled from "gcd.java"
    class gcd extends java.lang.Object{
    gcd();
      Code:
       0:   aload_0
       1:   invokespecial   #1; //Method java/lang/Object."<init>":()V
       4:   return

    public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
      Code:
       0:   getstatic       #2; //Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
       3:   ldc     #3; //String Hello World!
       5:   invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
       8:   return

    }

The following technique can be used to sample the bad path from "any"
program running on a linux OS -- for which you have the assembly code.
It uses [[http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/news/][oprofile]] and is able to associate the memory addresses
reported by oprofile with lines of assembly files.

alright, so this is working with oprofile.  First oprofile must be
turned on with something like the following...
: opcontrol --start

then either the good or bad test-case should be run some number of
times

then the annotated assembly can be read out with a command like the
following.
: opannotate --assembly ../../null

the output of that command looks something like
#+begin_example
     1  0.3257 : 804f318:       cmpl   $0x1,-0x10(%ebp)
     3  0.9772 : 804f31c:       je     804f323 <sgets+0x115>
               : 804f31e:       negl   -0xc(%ebp)
               : 804f321:       jmp    804f347 <sgets+0x139>
               : 804f323:       addl   $0x1,-0xc(%ebp)
     1  0.3257 : 804f327:       mov    0x8(%ebp),%eax
               : 804f32a:       movzbl (%eax),%eax
               : 804f32d:       cmp    $0xa,%al
     1  0.3257 : 804f32f:       jne    804f337 <sgets+0x129>
               : 804f331:       addl   $0x1,0x8(%ebp)
#+end_example

and should be usable for assigning good/bad paths to the assembly file

finally shut down with
: opcontrol --shutdown

and find out how to clear out the resident information before
profiling the next path

putting this all together to get some paths
1) get the mapping from memory addresses to lines in the assembly file
   : clj ../mem-mapping.clj httpd_comb.s null
2) stop the daemon
   : sudo opcontrol --shutdown
3) clear out old information
   : sudo opcontrol --reset
4) start up the daemon
   : sudo opcontrol --start
5) run the good test 10 times
   #+begin_src sh
     for i in `seq 10`; do
         j=`expr $i - 1`
         ./test-good.sh ./null output 401$j
     done
   #+end_src
6) dump the annotations to lines in the assembly file and save the
   results in good.path

15:46 <_schulte_> I'd think that there would be a general utility
                  for sampling the program counter of a running
                  program, but I've not been able to find anything
15:47 <jankratochvil> _schulte_: Sampling for which purpose? For
                      profiling purposes it is done by gcc -pg &
                      gprof, currently superseded by oprofile.
15:48 <jankratochvil> For GDB-script programming see: $ info
                      '(gdb)Command Files'
15:48 <_schulte_> jankratochvil: I need to find out which lines of
                  an assembly file are being executed, and with
                  what frequency
15:49 <jankratochvil> For python programming: $ info '(gdb)Python'
15:49 <_schulte_> if I can just get the contents of the program
                  counter then I can use that to get the related

15:49 <jankratochvil> _schulte_: So maybe gcov but I do not have
                      experience with it myself.
15:50 <_schulte_> jankratochvil: thanks, so far everything I've
                  looked into works over C files, and need to be
                  able to instrument the generated assembly --
                  which isn't possible in my case
15:51 <jankratochvil> These tools generally just insert some call
                      into prologue and epilogue so you can insert
                      it there yourself to catch the point when
                      execution enters your function.  See `gcc -S'
                      output for these called instrumentation
                      functions.
15:53 <_schulte_> jankratochvil: alright, that sounds promising,
                  I'll give it a try. thanks
15:54 <jankratochvil> np, perusing these instrumentation gcc calls
                      can be useful. :-)
16:01 <_schulte_> it looks like I can also attach to a running
                  program, and then use step/stepi to inspect the
                  state.  maybe wrapping that in a shell script
                  which I could repeatedly call would be
                  sufficient...
16:09 <jankratochvil> _schulte_: If you do not need to catch _each_
                      entry and you want just some statistical
                      sample then you want oprofile.  Or you can
                      implement it yourself by fast setitimer()
                      handler saving the - probably caller's caller
                      - PC each time.
16:10 <jankratochvil> oprofile - contrary to gprof - does not need
                      any instrumentation and DWARF debug info is
                      enough for it.
16:10 <_schulte_> jankratochvil: that sounds perfect, thanks!

  this can be accomplished using Java's =.hashCode= method directly on

So this is inspired fairly directly by VU's challenge script, which
takes advantage of the fact that our current system can't
differentiate between failing a test by returning the wrong result --
(e.g. printing 56 instead of 55) and failing a test for more serious
reasons like throwing a segfault or entering an infinite loop.

Here we'll try assigning test results in a less dramatic fashion,
basically we'll give 1 point for passing the test, 0 points for a
non-0 exit (either segfault or infinite loop), and a new gradation of
0.5 points just for exiting cleanly.  While it would be possibly to do
much more like assigning fitness based on running time this seems just
fine for now.

will print the time taken to run the command to STDERR, so for example
the output of a working gcd will be
#+begin_example
real    0m0.006s
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.004s

and the output of a broken infinite-loop gcd will be
#+begin_src
real    0m0.998s
user    0m1.004s
sys     0m0.000s
#+end_src
so it should be fairly easy to catch this STDERR output in clojure and
use it to adjust the score of the resulting scripts.

genprog makes good use of "good paths" and "bad paths" to see which
portions of a source-code files are run during both the good and bad
tests.  This information is used to focus on the mutation of
source-code files towards those lines involved in failing the bad
test.

This work will benefit from the ability to find which lines of an
assembly file are used during execution of each test.  Luckily gdb
makes this task relatively simple -- as long as the lines in question
are contained inside of a named function (for example =main=).

see
- [[gdb-script]] for a script which runs a file and returns the value of
  the program counter after each step of assembly execution
- [[mem-to-asm]] for a clojure script which takes the path to the asm file
  and can accept the output of [[gdb-script]] through a pipe and spits out
  the loc in the assembly file related to the program counter sampled
  by gdb

not an easy consistent mapping.

1) first we need to generate the good and bad paths

   A different command for each reflecting different good and bad
   arguments to the gcd executable.
   #+begin_src sh
     gdb -batch gcd -x data/good-profile.gdb |clj mem-to-asm.clj gcd.s > good.path

   and
   #+begin_src sh
     gdb -batch gcd -x data/bad-profile.gdb |clj mem-to-asm.clj gcd.s > bad.path
   #+end_src

2) then we can take the bad-path subtract the good-path, and that
   should provide a good indication of where the GP should focus.
   #+begin_src clojure
     (def bad-path
          (reduce

                         (dissoc a f))))

As it turns out a strict bad path on the assembly instruction level
can be too narrow.  For example on the gcd.s code the bad path limits
the GP operations to the lines following =.L6:= -- namely the code
implementing the infinite loop

#+begin_src asm
  .L8:
          fldl    64(%esp)
          fstpl   4(%esp)
          movl    $.LC1, (%esp)
          call    printf
          jmp     .L4
  .L6:
          fldl    72(%esp)
          fldl    64(%esp)
          fxch    %st(1)
          fucompp
          fnstsw  %ax
#+end_src

however the solution needed to fix gcd.s is to replace the line
immediately preceding =.L6= to return *before* entering the infinite
loop.

to resolve this issue I'm going to try two things
1) I'll apply the log of the bad-path program counters rather than the
   actual number -- which is often in the thousands make weighted
   selection of non-bad-path lines of code practically impossible
   #+begin_src clojure
     (apply hash-map
            (apply concat
                   (map #(list (first %)
                               (m/log (inc (second %)))) bad-path)))
   #+end_src

2) I'll smooth out the weight so that the weight of a line is
   influenced by the weights of it's neighbors, lets say something
   like
   | 6% | 24% | 38% | 24% | 6% |
   #+begin_src clojure
     (let [kernel {-3 0.006, -2 0.061, -1 0.242, 0 0.383, 1 0.242, 2 0.061, 3 0.006}]
       (reduce ;; for each weighted element of the bad-path
        (fn [accum el]
          (reduce ;; for each part of the kernel
           #(let [place (+ (first el) (first %2))]
              (assoc %1 place
                     (+ (get %1 place 0)
                        (* (second %2) (second el)))))
           accum kernel))
        {} bad-path))
   #+end_src

doctoring has the following effect on the weights of the bad path
#+source: bad-path
#+begin_src clojure :session asm-gp :exports none
  (map #(apply list %) bad-path)
#+end_src
#+begin_src gnuplot

3) Then to adjust our GP functions so that they take account of the
   good and bad weights... done

4) Then generate a baseline with both good and bad path info
   #+begin_src clojure
     (def baseline
          (apply-path
           (apply-path (read-asm "gcd.s")
                       :good-weight good-path)
           :bad-weight bad-path))
   #+end_src

After four quick runs the GP was able to find a solution in *all four
runs*, which is a drastic improvement over all previous attempts.  I
guess it remains to be seen how well this improvement transfers to
other programs but it is encouraging.

** CANCELED bias GP operations towards common command patterns

1) first build a model of the command patterns in *.s files (see
   [[r-source-cmd-model]])
2) write a function which uses a model to run the products of GP
   operations through tournaments (see [[better-gp-op]]) which seems to
   work with lines like
   #+begin_src clojure
     (better-gp-op del-asm baseline full-model 9)
   #+end_src

For some reason this doesn't really seem to help.

*** mutation
Currently we swap the "argument" portion of a command with another
"argument" from the same command in the assembly file.  It might be
nice to come up with a good way to "change" rather than "swap" the
value of this argument -- possibly even keep a running list of all of
the possible valid values.
